# ðŸŒ¾ Crop-Bug Detection

A full-stack web application for smart agriculture: growers can upload crop/leaf images to detect bugs/diseases and receive AI-based crop recommendations based on soil and environmental data.
Link: https://crop-bug-detection.vercel.app/

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Crop & Disease Detection**  
  Detect plant diseases or pest damage in uploaded images using AI-powered image recognition.

- **Real-Time Bug Prediction**  
  Get immediate insights from uploaded leaf/crop images, powered by real-time machine learning models.

- **Downloadable Reports & Notebooks**  
  Easily access and download detailed analysis reports, Jupyter notebooks, and prediction results directly from the website.

- **Crop Recommendations**  
  Get suggestions for optimal crops based on soil properties (N, P, K, pH, moisture), weather data, and geographic region.

- **Soil-Report Insights**  
  Analyze soil test reports and understand nutrient needs using AI-backed recommendations.

- **Responsive & Modern UI**  
  Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean, mobile-first experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Python (3.8+) & Flask
- Jupyter Notebook (for dataset preprocessing / model training)
- `.env` file with:
  ```
  OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
  SOIL_API_KEY=your_api_key
  ```
- Optional: credentials or endpoints for soil testing & pricing APIs


### 4. Model Training & Data

In `notebooks/crop_analysis.ipynb`, you'll find preprocessing scripts and ML model training examples. To retrain:

1. Populate `data/` folder (e.g., leaf/tissue analysis, test datasets).
2. Run notebook to output `models/*.pkl`.
3. Load into Flask API for dynamic inference.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/         # React / Next.js UI
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/          # Flask APIs for detection & advisory
|   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
|   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
|   â””â”€â”€ models/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ crop_model.pkl

â”œâ”€â”€ data/             # Raw and processed datasets
â””â”€â”€ docs/             # Design specs, deployment guides
```

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### Crop/Disease Detection

1. User uploads an image via frontend.
2. Frontend sends to Flask `/predict` endpoint.
3. Flask uses a pre-trained ML model (e.g. CNN) to infer disease/pest presence.
4. Returns disease name and confidence score to the UI.

### Crop Recommendation

1. User inputs soil parameters (NPK, pH, moisture, location).
2. Frontend POSTs to `/recommend`.
3. Flask applies rule-based or trained model logic to suggest top crops.
4. Returns best-fit crops + expected yields.

## ðŸ§  AI Components (Simulated ðŸ”§)

We simulated the AI logic; to add real AI:

- **Model training**  
  Use scikitâ€‘learn/PyTorch in Jupyter notebooks.

- **Weather & Market APIs**  
  Integrate with OpenWeatherMap, AgriMarket, or local data sources.

- **Chatbot**  
  Connect with ChatGPT or any LLM via OpenAI API and embed in the frontend.

## ðŸ—£ Languages & Transliteration

- Multi-language UI (EN, HI, MR).  
- Use `i18n/` for text translation.  
- Connect chatbot to translations for natural-language support.
